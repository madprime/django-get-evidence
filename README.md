django-get-evidence
===================

Welcome to Madeleine's Django rewrite of GET-Evidence, a work in progress. 
This is a project to recreate the functionality of the current GET-Evidence,
hosted at [evidence.personalgenomes.org](http://evidence.personalgenomes.org) with code available at
[github.com/PersonalGenomeProject/get-evidence](https://github.com/PersonalGenomeProject/get-evidence).

Installation
------------
These instructions were written for Ubuntu Linux (since that's what I use).
If you use another system, please go ahead and submit modifications to this file
to describe alternate instructions. Thanks!

1. Navigate to the directory you want to have the code in, and clone the 
repository with: `git clone git://github.com/madprime/django-get-evidence`.`
2. **(Root user action)** Install Postgres with: `sudo apt-get install postgres` 
3. **(Postgres user action)** Create a new Postgres user with: `sudo -i -u postgres createuser getevidence -P`
with the password: `glassworks`. (This password a placeholder and is stored in the current settings,
developing a real password is a TODO.) You should answer "n" to superuser, "y" to creating databases,
and "n" to creating new roles.
4. **(Postgres user action)** Create a getevidence database with:
`sudo -i -u postgres createdb -O getevidence getevidence`
5. **(Root user action -- If you know virtualenv, please feel free to use that instead 
and update these instructions.)** Navigate to top directory in this project. (One of the subdirectories
should be "requirements".) Install the Python and Django packages required for development with 
`sudo pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`.
6. Navigate to the django-get-evidence/getevidence/. Run `python manage.py syncdb`. You should probably 
create a superuser account for admin; set it to whatever you wish.
7. You can now run a local version with `python manage.py runserver --settings=getevidence.settings.dev`
